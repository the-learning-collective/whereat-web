# Security Tips

As one who protests, you are (sadly) the target of a broad arsenal of surveillance tactics. We've designed where@ to protect you from [as many of these tactics as possible](https://about.whereat.io/threat-model), but some things are beyond our control. To have maximum safety while using this app during a protest, we __strongly encourage you to do the following:

## Obscure your IP address

When you send data through where@, you can think of it like sending a letter inside an envelope. We've done everything we can to make sure nobody (including us!) can see what's inside the envelope. However, anyone who's looking can see the "to" and "from" addresses on the outside of the envelope. This knowledge can produce valuable surveillance information that could endanger you and your friends.

To help protect you from this threat, we __strongly recommend that you download and install software that hides the "from" address of your phone.__ The simplest kind of software that does this is called VPN (which stands for "Virtual Private Network"). It works by sending all of your internet traffic through an intermediary server that then sends your data to us. That way, if someone is spying on all traffic addressed to our "to" address, they'll only see the "from" address of the VPN server, and not your phone!

### On an Android

* [Install Bitmask](https://bitmask.net/en/install/android) -- learn more about Bitmask and the LEAP Encryption Access Project [here](https://leap.se/)
* Use Bitmask to setup a [Riseup Black account](https://black.riseup.net/)
* If you see a "key" icon on the top of your screen, it worked! Your IP Address is now obscured for all internet traffic!

### On an iPhone

* [Follow this guide](http://sett.com/wischi/riseupVPN-iOS) -- more documentation forthcoming! But also: if you go to protests a lot consider getting a cheap Android that you only use for protests. Security is really much easier on Androids!

## Only "trust" people you actually trust

The current version of where@ shows you location data from all users using the app. Future versions will allow you to share your identity along with your location updates with trusted friends. In both instances, if you see a location update and don't know who it's from: assume that it *might* be misinformation shared to deliberately mislead you, and make decisions about what decisions you want to make based off of that information accordingly.

## Send encrypted text messages

While where@ is great for sharing your location, we know you'll also probably want to talk to your friends to share information. There are several easy-to-use options to allow you to send encrypted text messages. We highly encourage you to use Signal:

* [Install Signal for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&hl=en)
* [Install Signal for iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669)

Learn more about Open Whisper Systems, who makes Signal [here](https://whispersystems.org/).

## Use your noggin!

We've done what we can to help you stay safe from state surveillance, but all the tools in the world aren't a panacea against repression. When you go out into the streets, always take a second to think about what information you're sharing with whom, no matter what tool you're using. If it feels like it might be risky to share something with people you don't know: don't do it!

## See you in the streets!
